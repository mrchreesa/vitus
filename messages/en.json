      "description": "Vitus Centre offers individual and group supervision to professionals in the supporting professions such as psychologists, counsellors, and social workers.

Supervision assists the individual professional and/or the team of professionals, on the one hand, in better understanding and recognising problematic areas in service users  and, on the other, in building a sustainable interaction among the professionals. In addition, it creates conditions for awareness of one's own behaviour in the profession and the associated feelings, as well as inspires motivation for positive change.\n\nThe experts at Vitus Centre have extensive experience in conducting individual and group supervision. They are trained to use the Cyclical model of supervision developed by Steve Page and Val Wosket, as well as the Process model of supervision developed by Peter Hawkins and Robin Shohet."
